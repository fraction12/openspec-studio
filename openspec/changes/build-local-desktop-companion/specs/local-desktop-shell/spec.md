## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Standalone local desktop application
The system SHALL run as a standalone local desktop application without requiring the user to start a development server.

#### Scenario: User launches the app normally
- **WHEN** the user opens OpenSpec Studio from the operating system
- **THEN** the app starts without requiring `npm run dev` or a browser-served web app
- **AND** the app can operate against local repositories on the same machine

#### Scenario: App remains local-first
- **WHEN** the app indexes or displays OpenSpec data
- **THEN** it reads from local repositories and local CLI output
- **AND** it does not require an account, cloud service, or remote database

### Requirement: Repository selection
The system SHALL allow the user to select a local repository to inspect.

#### Scenario: User selects a valid OpenSpec repo
- **WHEN** the user selects a folder containing an `openspec/` directory
- **THEN** the app accepts the folder as the active repository
- **AND** it begins indexing the OpenSpec workspace

#### Scenario: User selects a folder without OpenSpec
- **WHEN** the user selects a folder that does not contain an `openspec/` directory
- **THEN** the app reports that no OpenSpec workspace was found
- **AND** it does not create or modify project files without explicit user action

### Requirement: Recent repository access
The system SHALL remember recently opened repositories as app-local convenience state.

#### Scenario: User reopens a recent repo
- **WHEN** the user launches the app after previously opening repositories
- **THEN** the app shows recent repository paths
- **AND** selecting one reopens that repo if it still exists
